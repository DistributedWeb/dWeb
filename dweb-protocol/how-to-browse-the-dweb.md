# How To Browse The Distributed Web

Thanks to our release of [dBrowser](https://dbrowser.io), users can easily browse the distributed web, using the dweb:// protocol. You can also launch dSites and/or dApps straight from your browser. dBrowser comes with a built-in distributed repository for dSites and dApps that you create or fork within the browser itself and may I add - all dSites and dApps published over DWEB are forkable. What this means is, the entire distributed web is open source and we're proud of that.

dBrowser has many features coming to it in the coming months including payments and donations for dSites and/or dApps that can be ran through the dBank DAB, as well as a complete redesign of the browser UI/UX.
