# dWeb vs. Regular Web

Like the "Hypertext Transfer Protocol" or HTTP/S, also used in the forms of http:// or https://, [DWEB](https://dwebs.io) is a protocol used to access files over a network. The only difference in the two is HTTP/S accesses files over internet addresses, also known as IP addresses (IPv4 or IPV6) and this can be on a local network that is private to the world or a public network that is completely open to the entire planet. To host a website over HTTP, can be done via a computer, which is rare and really not a pragmatic solution if a website utilizes large media files or has a lot of traffic, because a user can burn a lot of bandwidth and ISPs (Internet Service Providers) in most cases, do not allow for home or business users of their service, use it for hosting websites and/or applications. For this reason, most developers use a hosting company, where either shared, cloud or dedicated servers are purchased/rented via a hosting service or "colocated" in a data center, to where files can be served over enterprise-level networks and scaled over time to distribute to a growing user-base. This can be costly and quite frankly a waste, especially once you have used the server-less and host-less distributed web.
