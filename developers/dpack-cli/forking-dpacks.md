## Forking/Downloading dPacks

```
dweb fork dweb://<link> <download-dir>
```

Use `dweb fork` to download files from a remote computer distributing files with dPack over the dWeb. This will download the files from `dweb://<link>` to your `<download-dir>`. The download exits after it completes but you can continue to update the files later after the fork is done. Use `dweb pull` to update new files or `dweb sync` to live sync changes via the dWeb.

Try out `dweb fork` with the link above to read more about the protocol!
