# dPack CLI Installation

## Environment Requirements

* Node Version 4 or above.
* NPM (Version installed with your Node installation)

## Installation

### Install With NPM
```
npm install -g @dpack/cli*
```

### Install With YARN
```
npm install -g @dpack/cli*
```

### One-Line Installer

If you are unable to use `npm` to install dPack, you can also download a single file binary distribution version of `dweb` using the one line install command below. The binary includes a copy of `@dpack/core` and `dweb` packaged inside a single file, so you just have to download one file in order to start sharing data across the Distributed Web (dWeb), with no other dependencies needed on your system:

```
curl https://dpack.io/installer/cli.sh | bash && dweb
```
