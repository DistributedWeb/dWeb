## dPack Repository and Authentication

Steps to registering as a developer on the dPack repository:
- Create an account at [dpacks.io](https://dpacks.io)
- Login via the dPack CLI by running `dweb login`
- Authenticate with the dPacks.io server
- You are now able to push dSites and dApps via a dPack to the dWeb's official distributed repository.


To test and see if you're completely authenticated - run this command:

```
dweb fork dpacks.io/dpack/demo-fork
```
